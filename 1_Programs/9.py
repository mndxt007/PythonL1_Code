#A complex number is a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is an indeterminate satisfying i2 = âˆ’1. For example, 2 + 3i is a complex number

a=3+8j
b=9+16j

print(a,'and',b,'are 2 complex numbers')
print('Addition of a and b',a+b)
print('Substraction of a and b',a-b)
print('Multiplication of a and b',a*b)
print('Division of a and b',a/b)
input('Press any key to continue')

##Result:
##    (3+8j) and (9+16j) are 2 complex numbers
##    Addition of a and b (12+24j)
##    Substraction of a and b (-6-8j)
##    Multiplication of a and b (-101+120j)
##    Division of a and b (0.4599406528189911+0.0712166172106825j)
##    Press any key to continue
